Follow these steps to prodcue the tidy data and codebook
1. Download the file and put the file in the data folder
2. Unzip the file
3. unzipped files are in the folderUCI HAR Dataset. Get the list of the files
4. Read data from the files into the variables
5. Read the Subject files
6. Read Fearures files
7. Look at the properties of the above varibles
8. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
9. Concatenate the data tables by rows
10.set names to variables
11. Merge columns to get the data frame Data for all data
12. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
13. Subset Name of Features by measurements on the mean and standard deviation
14. Subset the data frame Data by seleted names of Features
15. Check the structures of the data frame Data
16. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
17. Read descriptive activity names from “activity_labels.txt”
18.  facorize Variale activity in the data frame Data using descriptive activity names
19. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
20. Creates a second,independent tidy data set and ouput it
21. Prouduce Codebook
